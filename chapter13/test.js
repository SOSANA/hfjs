/*
 * Extra strength objects
 * 
 * JavaScript doesn’t have a classical object-oriented model, where you create objects from classes. 
 * In fact, JavaScript doesn’t have classes at all . In JavaScript, objects inherit behavior from 
 * other objects , which we call prototypal inheritance , or inheritance based on prototypes. Note 
 * This may change in the future: the next version of JavaScript may add classes.  
 * 
 * Typically when we talk about an object’s “behavior” we’re referring to the set of methods it supports.
 * 
 * Javascript Prototypes
 * Objects that can inherit properties and behavior from other objects. More 
 * specifically, JavaScript uses what is known as prototypal inheritance , and the object you’re inheriting 
 * behavior from is called the prototype . The whole point of this scheme is to inherit and reuse existing 
 * properties (including methods), while extending those properties in your brand new object. When an object 
 * inherits from another, it gains access to all its methods and properties.
