/*
 * Extra strength objects
 * 
 * JavaScript doesn’t have a classical object-oriented model, where you create objects from classes. 
 * In fact, JavaScript doesn’t have classes at all . In JavaScript, objects inherit behavior from 
 * other objects , which we call prototypal inheritance , or inheritance based on prototypes. Note 
 * This may change in the future: the next version of JavaScript may add classes.
